In this repository you will find the work I did in CMSC 202, the second introductory computer science course at UMBC. In this class I was introduced to C++ and built on my prior knowledge on programming. I have included the 5 projects I did in this class.

Project 1 was to make the game wordle, it was fairly simple and involves reading in a list of words from the included file and parsing the string for the user to play the game. I did the extra credit portion which added color to the letters like
you would wee when playing the actual game on the new york times website.

Project 2 was more practice with parsing strings. Elements are read in from a file and the user is able to discover different elements using the menu options and create different chemicals by combining different elements.

Projects 3 was an introduction to linked lists by programming a port system. The user is able to create a route from different ports based on the list given. The route is stored as a dynamically allocated linked list.

Project 4 was more practice with strings as the goal of this project was to encrypt/decrypt different strings using three different ciphers: Caesar, Ong, and RailFence.

Project 5 was putting everything together by making a trivia game using a dynamically allocated lqueue. This project involved parsing strings, creating linked lists, getting user input and more and was the perfect summation of all the skills
I had learned up to that point.
